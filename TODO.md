# Devshare Library Todos

## High Priority
* [ ] Don't allow project owner to be added as a collaborator

### Long Term
* [ ] Allow "without" option when querying (i.e. search users without current user)
* [ ] See if zip can still be handled using library
* [ ] Read/Write access for files
* [ ] Store files in children parameter (does this break anything?)
* [ ] Docs
